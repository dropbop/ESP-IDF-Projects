# ESP-IDF Projects

Monorepo containing my ESP-IDF projects across various ESP hardware. Mostly snippet-type code and proof-of-concept sketches to verify something works as intended. Each project has its own README with details.

Secret details in each folder (e.g. wifi network details, API keys...) are kept as `secrets.h` files.

## Claude Code Plugin

This repo pairs well with [esp-idf-dev-plugin](https://github.com/dropbop/esp-idf-dev-plugin), a custom Claude Code skill that gives Claude up-to-date knowledge of ESP-IDF APIs, drivers, and project structure. Highly recommended if you're using Claude Code for ESP-IDF development.
